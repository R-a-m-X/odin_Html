    <h2>Description</h5>
        <p>Crispy Nuggets with a piping hot cup of tea is the ultimate combo one could enjoy during monsoons. With just
            a handful of ingredients like poha, potato, onion, capsicum, peas and a handful of spices, you can easily
            make some delicious nuggets at home. No need to deep-fry and make the snack extra-oily, as these nuggets can
            be prepared with just 2 tbsp of oil. To make the nuggets crispier, we have dipped them in a cornflour slurry
            and coated them in breadcrumbs. If you don't have breadcrumbs, you can skip this step as well. To add a
            touch of cheesiness to the nuggets, stuff a small piece of cheese in the nuggets before frying them. Pair up
            the nuggets with tomato ketchup and mint chutney to make them wholesome. If you like to try out new recipes,

                sides.</p>
            <li>Shallow fry</li>
            <p>
                Heat 2 tbsp oil in a pan. Place the nuggets in the pan and shallow fry until golden brown in colour.</p>
